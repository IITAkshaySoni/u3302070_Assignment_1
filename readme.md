# Automated Pet Feeder System – Assignment 1

## 📚 Introduction to Information Technology (4478/8936)

This repository contains all components of Assignment 1, where I applied the Problem-Solving Process to design the logic for a low-cost, automated pet feeder for a local animal shelter. The solution simulates the system's behavior using structured logic, flowcharts, and test scenarios.


## 🔍 Project Overview

The automated feeder is designed to:
- Dispense food for pets at scheduled times (e.g., 08:00 and 18:00)
- Detect whether the food has been eaten using sensors
- Alert staff if food is not eaten or the container is empty
- Be implemented later using basic hardware (e.g., servo motor, sensors)
