# Automated Pet Feeder System – Assignment 1

Introduction to Information Technology (8936)

This repository contains all components of Assignment 1, where I applied the Problem Solving Process to design the logic for a low cost, automated pet feeder for a local animal shelter. The solution simulates the system's behavior using structured logic, flowcharts, and test scenarios.


# Project Overview

The automated feeder is designed to:
- Dispense food for pets at scheduled times (08:00 and 18:00)
- Detect whether the food has been eaten using sensors
- Alert staff if food is not eaten or the container is empty
- Be implemented later using basic hardware (servo motor, sensors)
